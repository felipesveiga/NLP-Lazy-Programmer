Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having\\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\\nmethodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to\\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.',\n",
       " 'There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her\\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.',\n",
       " 'Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\\ndo you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?',\n",
       " 'But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of\\nthem—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\\nand avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\\nthose ships attract them thither?',\n",

Take\\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\\nreveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\\nprofessor.

What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\\nshepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were\\nfixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\\nTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop\\nof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\\nyour thousand miles to see it?

Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.',\n",
       " 'Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\\nget sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy\\nthemselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;\\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\\nAnd as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory\\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I\\nnever fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously\\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.',\n",
       " 'No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,\\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\\nin time.',\n",

What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t\\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\\norder me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\\none way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or\\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,\\nand be content.',\n",
       " 'Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\\npaid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\\nourselves to perdition!',\n",
       " 'Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\\nsome unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,\\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.

       " 'Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let\\nme—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\\nthe place one lodges in.',\n",

Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.',\n",
       " 'As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\\nwas her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the\\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\\nimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\\nbowsprit?',\n",
       " 'Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

With anxious grapnels I had\\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,\\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\\nnorth with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you\\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\\ninquire the price, and don’t be too particular.',\n",

Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t\\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\\nthe cheeriest inns.',\n",

At\\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\\nGomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then\\nmust needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and\\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\\ndoor.',\n",
       " 'It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit.

Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’',\n",
       " 'Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\\nunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”',\n",
       " 'Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.',\n",
       " 'It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\\nas it were, and leaning over sadly.

Euroclydon, nevertheless,\\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\\nglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\\nmind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\\nwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.',\n",

Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\\norder to keep out this frost?',\n",

On one side hung a very large\\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.',\n",

A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\\na nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\\nit, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\\ndeceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\\ngale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\\nblasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\\nthat one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?',\n",
       " 'In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\\nwhom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\\nin a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\\nthree dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\\npurposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\\nimpaling himself upon the three mast-heads.',\n",

You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\\nand savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\\nhorrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\\nand harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\\nSwain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\\nharpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\\nwith by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\\noriginal iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\\nsojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\\nwas found imbedded in the hump.',\n",

On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\\ngathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks.

Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\\nlike another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells\\nthe sailors deliriums and death.',\n",

       " 'At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said\\nhe couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\\nto our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\\nfare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but\\ndumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\\ngreen box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\\nmanner.',\n",

       " 'A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their\\nshaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,\\nall bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they\\nseemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from\\ntheir boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,\\nthat they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the\\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon\\nwhich Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never\\nmind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,\\nor on the weather side of an ice-island.',\n",

       " 'I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\\nnoise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\\nwill here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\\nfeet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\\nburnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\\ndeep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\\nto give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\\nSoutherner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\\nthose tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\\nthe revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\\nslipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\\ncomrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\\nshipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\\nthem, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\\nBulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.',\n",
       " 'It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the\\nentrance of the seamen.',\n",
       " 'No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but\\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\\nand that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\\nsleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.',\n",
       " 'The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\\nand going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\\nmidnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?',\n",
       " '“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep\\nwith him. I’ll try the bench here.”',\n",
       " '“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\\nmattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and\\nnotches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane\\nthere in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying\\nhe procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\\nthe bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\\nlike an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\\nplane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\\nnear spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the\\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\\nthe middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\\nbrown study.',\n",
       " 'I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\\nthan the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\\nunder the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\\nespecially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\\nthe window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\\nnight.',\n",
       " 'The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal\\na march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!',\n",
       " 'Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began\\nto think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\\nagainst this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be\\ndropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\\nwe may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.',\n",

       " 'The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he\\nanswered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\\nrise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\\na peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\\nunless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”',\n",
       " '“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\\ntelling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,\\nlandlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\\nthis town?”',\n",
       " '“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\\nsell it here, the market’s overstocked.”',\n",

       " '“Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”',\n",
       " '“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”',\n",
       " '“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\\nsnow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\\nnot yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,\\nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\\nnight with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\\nthat story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of\\nsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\\nsir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\\nyourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”',\n",
       " '“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long\\nsarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\\neasy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\\nfrom the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\\nheads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\\nthat one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it\\nwould not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is\\ngoin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\\nhe was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\\nall the airth like a string of inions.”',\n",
       " 'This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\\nsame time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\\nSaturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators?',\n",
       " '“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”',\n",
       " '“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful\\nlate, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me\\nslept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room\\nfor two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,\\nafore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\\nfoot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\\nsomehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\\nArter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a\\nglim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\\nme, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\\nharpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\\n_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”',\n",
       " 'I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\\nushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\\nwith a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.',\n",
       " '“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\\nthat did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make\\nyourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from\\neyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.',\n",
       " 'Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\\nthe four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\\nwhale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\\nhammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\\nlarge seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\\nlieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\\nstanding at the head of the bed.',\n",
       " 'But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\\nto nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\\nyou see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\\nand thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\\nharpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\\nof glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\\nlife. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\\nin the neck.',\n",
       " 'I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\\nthe bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\\nthe middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\\nlittle more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\\nthe harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\\nand then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\\nto the care of heaven.',\n",
       " 'Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\\nsleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\\na heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\\nthe room from under the door.',\n",
       " 'Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\\nthe floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\\ncords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\\nall eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\\nwhile employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,\\nhe turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\\nof a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\\nlarge blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\\nterrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\\nface so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\\nof a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had\\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\\nhonest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\\nsun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\\nthe middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\\nthing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\\nhat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\\nThere was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.',\n",
       " 'Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\\nhead-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\\nhim as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\\nenough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\\ncheckered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\\nover the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\\nWar, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\\nmore, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\\nwere running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\\nhe must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\\nin the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\\nthink of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!',\n",
       " 'But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\\nthat he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\\nor dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\\nthe pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\\nwith a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old\\nCongo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\\nthat this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\\nmanner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\\na good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\\ngoes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\\nsets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\\nandirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\\nso that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\\nor chapel for his Congo idol.',\n",
       " 'I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\\nill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\\nfire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\\nto be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the\\nbiscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to\\nfancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these\\nstrange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from\\nthe devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing\\nsome pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the\\nidol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket\\nas carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.',\n",
       " 'All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing\\nhim now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\\nI had so long been bound.',\n",
       " 'But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for\\nan instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\\nhandle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\\nthe light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\\nhis teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\\nnow; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.',\n",
       " 'Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.

       " '“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”\\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\\ndark.',\n",

       " '“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the\\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\\nhot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\\nBut thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\\nin hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.',\n",
       " '“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t\\nharm a hair of your head.”',\n",
       " '“Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that\\ninfernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”',\n",

       " '“Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\\nsitting up in bed.',\n",
       " '“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a\\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\\nmoment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\\nlooking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\\nthought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just\\nas much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.',\n",
       " '“Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\\nwhatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\\nturn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with\\nme. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”',\n",
       " 'This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\\nmotioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to\\nsay—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”',\n",

Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\\ncould hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\\ntogether; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.',\n",
       " 'My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them.

I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\\nbed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.',\n",
       " 'I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\\nof my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\\nshining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\\nand worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\\nher feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\\nlie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\\nmost conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\\nI have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\\nAt last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\\nslowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the\\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\\na shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\\nsilent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\\nseated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\\nfrozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\\never thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\\naway from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\\nall, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\\nconfounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\\noften puzzle myself with it.',\n",
       " 'Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm\\nthrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly\\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\\nbridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\\nhim—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\\nneck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\\nsleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of\\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\\nbed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\\na man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well\\nworth unusual regarding.',\n",
       " 'He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\\none, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his\\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\\nnext movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the\\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\\never heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\\nboots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\\nstage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\\nhis eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\\nones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\\nat the first go off of a bitter cold morning.',\n",
       " 'Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\\nparticularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\\ncorner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\\na little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\\nwall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\\nThinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\\nto know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\\nexceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.',\n",
       " 'The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\\nthe room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\\nharpoon like a marshal’s baton.',\n",

       " 'I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\\nthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\\nbedfellow.',\n",
       " 'However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\\ngood thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper\\nperson, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\\nbackward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\\nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about\\nhim, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.',\n",
       " 'The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\\nnight previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\\nnearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,\\nand sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and\\nharpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\\nbeards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning\\ngowns.',\n",
       " 'You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\\nyoung fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\\nwould seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\\nlanded from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\\nlighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\\nbleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\\ncould show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\\nseemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,\\ncontrasting climates, zone by zone.',\n",
       " '“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\\nwent to breakfast.',\n",
       " 'They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\\nin manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:\\nLedyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\\none; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But\\nperhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in\\nthe negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s\\nperformances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode\\nof attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort\\nof thing is to be had anywhere.',\n",
       " 'These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\\ngood stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\\nmaintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\\nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\\nslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire\\nstrangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\\nthey sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of\\nkindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they\\nhad never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\\nwhalemen!',\n",
       " 'But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of\\nthe table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\\ncannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\\ncordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\\nand using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\\nto the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\\ntowards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\\nevery one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly\\nis to do it genteelly.',\n",
       " 'We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\\ncoffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\\nbeefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\\nlike the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\\nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat\\non, when I sallied out for a stroll.',\n",

Yes, it\\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\\nhis youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\\nministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\\nwinter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\\nwrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\\nbloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No\\none having previously heard his history, could for the first time\\nbehold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\\ncertain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\\nadventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\\nhe carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\\nhis tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\\ncloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\\nby one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.',\n",
       " 'Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\\nladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\\nof a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\\nred worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\\nheaded, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\\ntaste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\\nhands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\\ncast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\\nreverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\\nascending the main-top of his vessel.',\n",
       " 'The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\\nwood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\\nthe pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\\nprepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\\nround, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\\nimpregnable in his little Quebec.',\n",
       " 'I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\\nmere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\\nCan it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\\nhis spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\\nand connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\\nself-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\\nwell of water within the walls.',\n",
       " 'But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\nborrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s\\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\\nship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\\nthe Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel\\nseemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\\noff—serenest azure is at hand.”',\n",

       " '\\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\\nthe proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the\\nfirst chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\\nJonah.’”',\n",
       " '“Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one\\nof the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what\\ndepths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant\\nlesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in\\nthe fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the\\nfloods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_\\nis this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a\\ntwo-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to\\nme as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the\\nsin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the\\ncommand of God—never mind now what that command was, or how\\nconveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God\\nwould have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he\\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we\\nmust disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein\\nthe hardness of obeying God consists.',\n",
       " '“With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men\\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\\nCaptains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks\\na ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto\\nunheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no\\nother city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.\\nAnd where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from\\nJoppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when\\nthe Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,\\nthe Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So\\ndisordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had\\nbeen arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no\\nbaggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him\\nto the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\\nfinds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as\\nhe steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for\\nthe moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s\\nevil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the\\nman assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but\\nstill serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a\\nwidow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I\\nguess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,\\none of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill\\nthat’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\\npass, and he descends into the cabin.',\n",
       " '“‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\\nout his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless\\nquestion mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.\\nBut he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\\nsail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,\\nthough the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that\\nhollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the\\nnext coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing\\nhim. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\\npassenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\\nthe Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage\\nmoney how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,\\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\\n‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with\\nthe context, this is full of meaning.',\n",
       " '“Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\\nfrontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s\\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\\nand it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\\npassage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m\\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,\\n‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock\\ncontains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain\\nlaughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\\nconvicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\\nand dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\\nlittle state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\\nclose, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\\nbeneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\\nhis bowels’ wards.',\n",
       " '“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\\noscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\\nhung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the\\nceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in\\nme!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my\\nsoul are all in crookedness!’',\n",
       " '“Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;\\nas one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy\\nanguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at\\nlast amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as\\nover the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and\\nthere’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,\\nJonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.',\n",
       " '“And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\\nglides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when\\nboxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is\\nshrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\\ntrampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,\\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving\\nthe seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides\\nof the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast\\nasleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead\\near, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy\\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave\\nafter wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs\\nroaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet\\nafloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the\\nsteep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\\ntormented deep.',\n",
       " '“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to\\nhigh Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then\\nhow furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine\\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask\\nhim who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer\\nto those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\\nhand of God that is upon him.',\n",
       " '“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven\\nwho hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well\\nmightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to\\nmake a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more\\nappalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating\\nGod for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\\ndeserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest\\nwas upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;\\nthen, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not\\nunreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.',\n",
       " '“And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water\\nbehind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed\\nunto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and\\nlearn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and\\nwail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with\\nthis, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards\\nHis holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;\\nnot clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing\\nto God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance\\nof him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah\\nbefore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a\\nmodel for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\\nlike Jonah.”',\n",
       " 'While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\\nwhen describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his\\nsimple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.',\n",
       " 'There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\\nclosed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.',\n",

I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that\\nJonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to\\nme, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come\\ndown from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,\\nand listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other\\nand more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the\\nliving God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true\\nthings, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\\nears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should\\nraise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God\\nby taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\\nreached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed\\nhim down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him\\nalong ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him\\nten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’\\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond\\nthe reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale\\ngrounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the\\nengulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the\\nfish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale\\ncame breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the\\ndelights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’\\nwhen the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\\nbeaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring\\nof the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,\\nshipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!',\n",
       " '“This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\\nthe living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from\\nGospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God\\nhas brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than\\nto appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe\\nto him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would\\nnot be true, even though to be false were salvation!

Is not the main-truck higher than\\nthe kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward\\ndelight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever\\nstands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong\\narms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has\\ngone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\\ntruth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out\\nfrom under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant\\ndelight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his\\nGod, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the\\nwaves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake\\nfrom this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness\\nwill be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final\\nbreath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal,\\nhere I die.

He\\nwould then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number\\none each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was\\nonly by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his\\nastonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.',\n",
       " 'With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and\\nhideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance\\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You\\ncannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I\\nsaw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\\nfiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\\nthousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty\\nbearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\\nhad had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,\\nhis forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked\\nmore expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to\\ndecide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent\\none. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s\\nhead, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long\\nregularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were\\nlikewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\\ntop. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.',\n",
       " 'Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\\nlooking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\\nbook. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\\nof his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do\\nnot know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their\\ncalm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,\\nwith the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;\\nappeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.\\nAll this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there\\nwas something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand\\nmiles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only\\nway he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though\\nhe were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;\\npreserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;\\nalways equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;\\nthough no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,\\nperhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of\\nso living or so striving.

Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\\nexcept his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\\nelement of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\\npart. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and\\nself-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\\nunilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\\nrevulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\\nperhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\\nawake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\\nfrom his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong\\nrepugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how\\nelastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\\nFor now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\\neven in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\\nthen. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of\\ninsurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.\\nWith our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the\\nTomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue\\nhanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.',\n",

His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\\non the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal\\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\\nnourished in his untutored youth.',\n",

But the ship, having her full complement of\\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence\\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\\nlow tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\\nthe water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\\nits prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\\nwhen the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\\nclimbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\\ndeck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\\nhacked in pieces.',\n",

Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\\ntold him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this\\nsea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down\\namong the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\\nno seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\\nenlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he\\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\\narts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\\nthan that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\\nmiserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s\\nheathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\\nsailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\\nspent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\\nlost.

But by and by, he said, he would return,—as\\nsoon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\\nproposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans.

Upon\\nthis, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\\nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\\nfor an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\\naccompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\\nsame watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\\nevery hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\\nboth worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\\nI now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\\ncould not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\\nwholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\\nwith the sea, as known to merchant seamen.',\n",

       " 'We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\\ndown to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\\nmuch—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\\nstreets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\\nasked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\\nmowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own\\nscythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,\\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.',\n",
       " 'Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\\nowners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\\nthing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\\nwhich to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\\nfast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”\\nsaid I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\\nthink. Didn’t the people laugh?”',\n",
       " 'Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very\\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this\\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a\\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\\nguests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain\\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\\nKing, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their\\ngrace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\\ntimes look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\\nthe ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I\\nsay, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\\nceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\\nceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain\\nprecedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own\\nhouse—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\\npunchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said\\nQueequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”',\n",

Huge hills and mountains of\\ncasks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\\nworld-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\\nfrom others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\\nof fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\\nwere on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\\nfor ever and for aye.

       " 'But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\\nmind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\\nthe weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\\nside, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\\nfellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\\nhands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\\nseemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\\none ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\\nsnapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\\nof being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\\nmidst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\\ncrawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured\\none end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,\\ncaught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next\\njerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was\\nrun into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern\\nboat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\\nliving arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\\nlike a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\\nturns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\\nlooked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\\nThe greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the\\nwater, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming\\nto see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes\\nmore, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other\\ndragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor\\nbumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the\\ncaptain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a\\nbarnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.',\n",

But to my surprise and no\\nsmall concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\\ndiligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo\\nhad told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\\neveryway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\\nharbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\\nYojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\\nwholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\\nto do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\\nI, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\\nit had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\\nmyself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.',\n",
       " 'I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast\\nof things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\\ngood sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\\nall cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.',\n",
       " 'Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection\\nof our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\\nrelied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\\ncarry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\\nproduced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\\naccordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\\nrushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\\ntrifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\\nwith Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of\\nLent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\\nQueequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\\nthough I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\\nliturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\\nshavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\\nships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\\nPequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\\n_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\\ntribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\\npeered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\\nTit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\\na moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.',\n",
       " 'You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\\nknow;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\\nschool, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\\nlook about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\\ncalms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a\\nFrench grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\\nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of\\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts\\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\\nancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\\nher old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had\\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\\ncommanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\\nof the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term\\nof his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\\ninlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or\\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\\nneck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\\ntrophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\\nbones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\\ngarnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\\nsperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\\nand tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\\nbut deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\\nwheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\\nwas in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\\nhereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\\nfelt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\\nits jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\\nare touched with that.',\n",
       " 'Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\\nfirst I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\\ntent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\\nblack bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\\nright-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\\nthe apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\\nto and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A\\ntriangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\\ninsider commanded a complete view forward.',\n",
       " 'And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\\nhis aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\\nship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\\ncommand. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\\nover with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\\nconstructed.',\n",
       " 'There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\\nthe elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\\ncontinual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\\nwindward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\\ntogether. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.',\n",
       " '“Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of\\nthe tent.',\n",
       " '“Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\\nhim?” he demanded.',\n",
       " '“I was thinking of shipping.”',\n",
       " '“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a\\nstove boat?”',\n",
       " '“No, Sir, I never have.”',\n",
       " '“Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?',\n",
       " '“Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been\\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”',\n",
       " '“Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\\nleg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\\nthe marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose\\nnow ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant\\nships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it\\nlooks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast\\nthou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of\\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”',\n",
       " 'I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of\\nthese half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\\nQuakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\\ndistrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\\nVineyard.',\n",
       " '“But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of\\nshipping ye.”',\n",
       " '“Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”',\n",
       " '“Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”',\n",
       " '“Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”',\n",
       " '“Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”',\n",
       " '“I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”',\n",
       " '“Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,\\nyoung man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\\nout for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\\nare part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest\\nto know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way\\nof finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap\\neye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one\\nleg.”',\n",
       " '“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”',\n",
       " '“Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed\\nup, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a\\nboat!—ah, ah!”',\n",
       " 'I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at\\nthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I\\ncould, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know\\nthere was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed\\nI might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”',\n",
       " '“Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou\\ndost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure\\nof that?”',\n",
       " '“Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\\nthe merchant—”',\n",
       " '“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\\nservice—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each\\nother. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel\\ninclined for it?”',\n",
       " '“I do, sir.”',\n",
       " '“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\\nwhale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”',\n",
       " '“I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”',\n",
       " '“Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\\nout by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\\nsee the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\\nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\\nto me and tell me what ye see there.”',\n",
       " 'For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\\nconcentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started\\nme on the errand.',\n",
       " 'Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\\npointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\\ncould see.',\n",
       " '“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye\\nsee?”',\n",
       " '“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\\nand there’s a squall coming up, I think.”',\n",
       " '“Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\\nround Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where\\nyou stand?”',\n",
       " 'I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\\nPequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now\\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\\nwillingness to ship me.',\n",
       " '“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come\\nalong with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\\ncabin.',\n",
       " 'Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\\neach owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\\nnail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\\nwhaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\\nstocks bringing in good interest.',\n",
       " 'Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by\\nthings altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.',\n",
       " 'So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\\nScripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in\\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the\\nQuaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\\nthese things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\\nbeneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or\\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes\\none in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for\\nnoble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\\nregarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For\\nall men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be\\nsure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\\nBut, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\\nand still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.',\n",
       " 'Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\\nBut unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called\\nserious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\\nveriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally\\neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but\\nall his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely\\nisland creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native\\nborn Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\\nvest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\\nconsistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\\nfoe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\\ntuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\\nof his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\\nreminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\\nand very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\\nconclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world\\nquite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\\nbroad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\\nchief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\\nbefore, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\\nactive life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\\ndays to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.',\n",
       " 'Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\\ntask-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\\nsore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\\nhe was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\\nto swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\\nat you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\\nsomething—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\\nsomething or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\\nbefore him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\\ncharacter. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\\nsuperfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\\nthe worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.',\n",
       " 'Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\\nwas small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\\nand never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\\nplaced beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\\nbuttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\\nreading from a ponderous volume.',\n",
       " '“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\\nstudying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”',\n",
       " 'As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.',\n",
       " '“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”',\n",
       " '“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.',\n",
       " '“I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.',\n",
       " '“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.',\n",
       " '“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible.',\n",
       " 'I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\\nhis friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\\nnothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\\nand drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\\nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\\nthe voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\\nno wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\\nof the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\\nthe degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\\nship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\\nown lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\\nsea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\\nthat from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\\nlay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\\nwhatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\\nwhat they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\\nif we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\\nwould wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,\\nfor which I would not have to pay one stiver.',\n",
       " 'It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\nfortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\\ngrim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\\n275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\\nsurprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\\nbroad-shouldered make.',\n",
       " 'But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\\nsomething of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\\nwhole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know\\nbut what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\\nshipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\\nwas such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for\\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”',\n",
       " '“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\\nshall we give this young man?”',\n",
       " '“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do\\ncorrupt, but _lay_—’”',\n",
       " '_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\\nshall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\\ncorrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\\nthe magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\\n_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\\nhundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.',\n",
       " '“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to\\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.”',\n",
       " '“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting\\nhis eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there\\nwill your heart be also.”',\n",
       " '“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do\\nye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”',\n",
       " 'Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\\n“Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,\\nmany of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\\nyoung man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\\norphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”',\n",
       " '“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\\ncabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\\nheavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\\nHorn.”',\n",
       " '“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing\\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art\\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\\ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”',\n",
       " '“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\\ninsult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\\nhe’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\\nand start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat\\nwith all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\\ndrab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”',\n",
       " 'As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.',\n",
       " 'Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\\nidea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\\nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\\nwrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\\nlittle as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the\\nsquall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\\nsharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\\nthe grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\\nIshmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\\nfor the three hundredth lay.”',\n",
       " '“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship\\ntoo—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”',\n",
       " '“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”',\n",
       " '“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\\nwhich he had again been burying himself.',\n",
       " '“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever\\nwhaled it any?” turning to me.',\n",
       " '“Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”',\n",
       " '“Well, bring him along then.”',\n",
       " 'And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\\nhad done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical\\nship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.',\n",
       " 'But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and\\nreceive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by\\narriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,\\nand the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the\\ncaptain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he\\ndoes not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to\\nthe owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to\\nhave a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his\\nhands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\\nAhab was to be found.',\n",

His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our\\nisle!

And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\\nGayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,\\nperhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn\\nthee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as\\nmate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,\\nlike Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a\\ngood deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;\\nand I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind\\nfor a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump\\nthat brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever\\nsince he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a\\nkind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all\\npass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young\\nman, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\\none. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens\\nto have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages\\nwedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\\nold man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm\\nin Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his\\nhumanities!”',\n",

And yet I also felt a strange\\nawe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\\nnot exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\\nnot disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\\nlike mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so\\nthat for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.',\n",

But no; there\\nhe was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\\nto grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\\nbe sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\\nholding a piece of wood on his head.',\n",
       " '“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\\nhave some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But\\nnot a word did he reply.',\n",
       " 'Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\\nordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\\nget into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\\nthought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\\nposition, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\\nawake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!',\n",
       " 'But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\\nwith a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.',\n",
       " 'Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,\\nbe it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\\nother person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when\\na man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\\nto him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\\nlodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\\nargue the point with him.',\n",
       " 'And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed\\nnow, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise\\nand progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\\nreligions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\\nQueequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\\nin cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\\nuseless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\\nand common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\\nan extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\\npained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\\nRamadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\\nhence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\\nnecessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\\nthrough the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.',\n",
       " 'I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the\\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.',\n",
       " '“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\\nhad visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\\nwhen a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\\nthe yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\\nplaced in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\\nwere sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just\\nas though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.',\n",
       " 'After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\\nseemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\\nfrom his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\\nthan one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\\nfinally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\\nreligion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\\nconcern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\\na sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\\npiety.',\n",
       " 'At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\\nmake much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\\nPequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.',\n",

       " 'As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\\nfrom his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,\\nand furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that\\ncraft, unless they previously produced their papers.',\n",
       " '“What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the\\nbulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.',\n",
       " '“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”',\n",
       " '“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from\\nbehind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.\\nSon of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present\\nin communion with any Christian church?”',\n",

       " '“Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\\n“Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast\\nhand; I never heard a better sermon.

       " '“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,\\nspose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he\\ndarted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the\\nship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.',\n",
       " '“Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e\\neye; why, dad whale dead.”',\n",
       " '“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin\\ngangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must\\nhave Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,\\nQuohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was\\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”',\n",

No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye?\\nWho knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess.

And\\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\\nto the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of\\nthe whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution\\nof the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote\\nharbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,\\nwhaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\\nthe success of the voyage most depends.

As for Bildad, he carried about with him\\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and\\nthen concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.',\n",

But I\\nbeat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\\nQueequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\\nestablish himself accordingly.

Besides, it was\\nvery convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\\nwhich are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\\nunder a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.',\n",

       " 'It was now clear sunrise.

And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\\nof him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\\nthen, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\\ngetting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\\nas that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\\nwas not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab\\nstayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\\nmerchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\\ncabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\\nbefore they quit the ship for good with the pilot.',\n",

       " '“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this\\nwhalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\\nPequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\\nto be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.',\n",
       " '“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and\\nthe crew sprang for the handspikes.',\n",

Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\\nno profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\\ncopy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.',\n",
       " 'Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\\nwould sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\\npaused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\\nthe perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\\na pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\\npious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\\nand seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\\nand turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity.

Spring, I\\nsay, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved\\nalong the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\\nimperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.

He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an\\nicy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\\nhard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\\nwould not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\\nof general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\\nhis state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties\\nand cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\\nmerely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\\nquite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\\nlike a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\\nlong ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\\nor torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\\nwarranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\\nto see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\\nhad calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\\nfor the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\\nchapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\\nwere certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\\ncases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\\nthe wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\\nhim to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\\norganizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\\nfrom ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\\nif at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\\ndid his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\\ntend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\\nand open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\\nhonest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\\nevinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\\nwill have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a\\nwhale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\\nuseful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\\nencountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\\ndangerous comrade than a coward.',\n",
       " '“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as\\ncareful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall\\nere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a\\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.',\n",

Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\\nthis business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\\nof the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\\nwasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\\nsun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\\nin fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\\ntheirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\\nWhat doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could\\nhe find the torn limbs of his brother?',\n",

And brave as he might be, it\\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\\ncannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged\\nand mighty man.',\n",

He was as particular about the comfortable\\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about\\nthe snugness of his box.

He would hum over his\\nold rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated\\nmonster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death\\ninto an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no\\ntelling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;\\nbut, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a\\nsort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\\nabout something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and\\nnot sooner.',\n",

For, like his nose, his short, black\\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\\nnose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\\nhe turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\\nthe other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\\nreadiness anew.

A\\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\\nand hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\\nhonor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\\nbulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\\nany possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\\nthe matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\\nthree years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\\nthat length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought\\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\\nwas one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\\ncalled him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\\nbe well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in\\nArctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers\\ninserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\\nof those battering seas.',\n",

In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of\\nGay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\\nand black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\\nAntarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently\\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have\\ncredited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and\\nhalf-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers\\nof the Air.

       " 'Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\\nfrom his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\\nthem ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\\nthem. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\\nlying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\\nanywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\\nmost frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\\nmanner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\\nand erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\\nfeet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\\nhim; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\\nbeg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,\\nAhasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a\\nchess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it\\nsaid, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men\\nbefore the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans\\nborn, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same\\nwith the American whale fishery as with the American army and military\\nand merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the\\nconstruction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,\\nbecause in all these cases the native American liberally provides the\\nbrains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No\\nsmall number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the\\noutward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews\\nfrom the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the\\nGreenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland\\nIslands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage\\nhomewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen.

       " 'For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\\nseen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the\\nwatches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed\\nto be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from\\nthe cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was\\nplain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and\\ndictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to\\npenetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.',\n",
       " 'Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\\ngazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\\ndisquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\\nsea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\\ntimes by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\\nof. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\\nprophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\\nuneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\\nabout me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\\nemotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\\nwere a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\\ntame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\\nacquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the\\nfierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\\nin which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\\naspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\\nmost forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\\nthem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\\nand gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\\nship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\\nand melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\\nthe forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\\ntaffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\\nCaptain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.',\n",
       " 'There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\\nrecovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\\nwhole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\\nunalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\\nfrom among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\\ntawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\\nsaw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\\ngreat tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\\ntop to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\\ngreenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\\nwhether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\\ncertainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\\nno allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\\nTashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\\nsuperstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\\nAhab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\\nfury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\\nwild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\\ninsinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\\nof Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\\nthe old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\\nthis old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\\nCaptain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to\\npass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the\\ndead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.',\n",
       " 'So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\\nlivid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly\\nnoted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\\nbarbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come\\nto me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\\nbone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said\\nthe old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped\\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”',\n",
       " 'I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\\nthe Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\\nplank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\\nholding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\\nbeyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\\nfortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\\nfearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\\ndid his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\\ngestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\\nonly that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\\nin his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\\nmighty woe.',\n",
       " 'Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\\nwhen the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\\nseemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\\nmaking a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\\nthe loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\\nfrom his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\\nMay, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\\nruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\\nfew green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\\nin the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\\nair. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\\nwhich, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\\nrolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\\nTropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\\nredundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\\nup—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\\nseemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\\nsuns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days\\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\\nweather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\\nworld. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\\nhours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\\nmost forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\\nand more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.',\n",
       " 'Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels\\nlike going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an\\nold captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my\\ngrave-dug berth.”',\n",
       " 'So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\\nman would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\\nway. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\\nto his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\\nheel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\\nstep, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\\nsharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;\\nand as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from\\ntaffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,\\nwith a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if\\nCaptain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\\nsomething indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\\ninsertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know\\nAhab then.',\n",
       " '“Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that\\nfashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\\nlast.—Down, dog, and kennel!”',\n",
       " 'Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\\n“I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\\nlike it, sir.”',\n",

Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the\\nfirst time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer\\ntoo; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb\\never sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is\\nhe mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be\\nsomething on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,\\nmore than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then.\\nDidn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always\\nfinds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the\\nsheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on\\nit? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a\\nconscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a\\ntoothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me\\nfrom catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the\\nafter hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s\\nthat for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in\\nthe hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old\\ngame—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be\\nborn into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think\\nof it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of\\nqueer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.\\nBut that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh\\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again.\\nBut how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times\\na donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as\\nwell have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I\\ndidn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It\\nflashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I\\ndon’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort\\nof turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\\nthough—How? how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to\\nhammock again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling\\nthinks over by daylight.”',\n",

Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\\ngone!

You know the old man’s\\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to\\nkick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And\\nthen, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept\\nkicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how\\ncurious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow\\nseemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an\\ninsult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not\\na real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between\\na living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the\\nhand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.\\nThe living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And\\nthinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly\\ntoes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it\\nall, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg\\nnow, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a\\nplayful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a\\nbase kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the\\nfoot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed\\nfarmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is\\nwhittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the\\ndream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of\\nbadger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\\nshoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!\\nman, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was\\nover the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business\\nis that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a\\nkick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned\\nround his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\\nhad for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his\\nstern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\\nsecond thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’\\nsaid he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of\\neating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to\\nstop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as\\nwell fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my\\nfoot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,\\n‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s\\nargue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’\\nsays I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory\\nleg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise\\nStubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good\\nwill? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you\\nwere kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s\\nan honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England\\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and\\nmade garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were\\nkicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_\\nkicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;\\nfor you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’\\nWith that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to\\nswim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my\\nhammock!

       " 'Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\\nwhale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\\nHowever contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\\nvertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\\nthough it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\\nposition.',\n",

He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the\\nonly creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was\\nthat quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable\\nof the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you\\nnowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of\\ntime, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was\\nstill retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a\\nnotion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation\\nmust at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this\\nspermaceti was really derived.',\n",

Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by\\nall the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black\\nWhale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a\\ndeal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\\nmultitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in\\nthe second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the\\nEnglish naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the\\nBaleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the\\nSwedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been\\nhunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale\\nwhich the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on\\nthe Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of\\nthe world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.',\n",

In the length he attains, and\\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great\\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting\\nfolds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,\\nfrom which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin\\nis some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder\\npart of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\\nthis isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the\\nsurface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with\\nspherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows\\nupon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and\\nwavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes\\nback. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some\\nmen are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his\\nstraight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear\\nupon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in\\nswimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems\\nthe banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark\\nthat style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic\\nspecies denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of\\nthese so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several\\nvarieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\\nwhales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.',\n",
       " 'In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of\\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded\\nupon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that\\nthose marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to\\nafford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other\\ndetached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.\\nHow then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the\\nhumpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.\\nThen, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these\\nhas baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the\\nsame with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,\\nthey form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of\\nthem detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all\\ngeneral methodization formed upon such a basis.

Yet we have\\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already\\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales\\nbodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.\\nAnd this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\\none that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable.

He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose.

The\\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal.

       " 'The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced\\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\\nperson now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\\nthose days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation\\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more\\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\\nboat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\\nground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\\npolitical maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\\nfrom the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\\ntheir social equal.',\n",

But\\npresently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\\ndeck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.\\nStarbuck,” disappears into the cabin.',\n",
       " 'When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,\\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\\nand, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\\npleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second\\nEmir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\\nmain brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\\nrope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,\\nMr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.',\n",
       " 'But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\\nshoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\\nover the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\\nprocessions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,\\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.',\n",
       " 'It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\\nsame commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\\ntable; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\\ndifference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\\nprivate dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power\\nand dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty\\nof state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.\\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\\nship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.',\n",
       " 'Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\\non the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved\\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\\nthereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his\\nmeat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\\nstarted if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\\nit noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\\nprofoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\\nwere somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\\nAhab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\\nit was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\\nbelow. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\\nof this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\\nhis would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\\nhimself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\\nfirst degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\\nmore would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\\nnevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\\nhelped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\\nLeast of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\\nthought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\\nclotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\\nlong a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\\ntherefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\\nwas a butterless man!',\n",
       " 'Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\\nis the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly\\njammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\\neven, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\\nappetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\\nmust bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\\nday; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\\ndeck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\\nsince he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\\nhad never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\\nFor what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\\nfrom my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\\nold-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\\nthe mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of\\nglory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any\\nmere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s\\nofficial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\\nawful Ahab.',\n",
       " 'Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\\nin the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\\norder to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\\nthree harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\\nlegatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and\\nmighty cabin.',\n",
       " 'In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\\ninvisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free\\nlicense and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\\nfellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\\nof the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\\ntheir food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\\nlike lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\\nwith spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\\nto fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\\nDough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\\ndid not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\\nungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\\nharpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\\nDough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\\nbegan laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\\nnaturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\\nand the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\\nDough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\\nover.',\n",
       " 'It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\\nhis filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\\nlow carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\\ncabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\\na ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\\nbroad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\\nfed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\\nbeef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\\nmortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so\\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\\nmarks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\\nTashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\\nbe picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\\nhanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\\ndid the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\\ntheir lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\\nthey would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\\nthat in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\\nguilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\\nhard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\\nshould he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his\\ngreat delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to\\nhis credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling\\nin them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.',\n",
       " 'But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\\nthere; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\\nscarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\\nwhen they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.',\n",
       " 'In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\\ncaptains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\\nthe ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\\nanybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\\nthe mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\\nhave lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\\nwas something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\\nmoment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\\nresiding in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\\nwas no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\\nincluded in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\\nlived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\\nof the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\\nwinter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\\nage, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\\nupon the sullen paws of its gloom!',\n",

       " 'It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\\nother seamen my first mast-head came round.',\n",
       " 'In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\\nsimultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may\\nhave fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\\ncruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she\\nis drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial\\neven—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\\nskysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\\nrelinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.',\n",
       " 'Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\\nvery ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\\nhere. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\\ntheir tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\\nor Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\\ndread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\\nbelief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\\nastronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\\nstair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\\nprodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\\nwont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\\nlook-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\\nin sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\\nwho built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\\nground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a\\ndauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\\nplace by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\\neverything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\\nstanders-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,\\nand bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,\\nare still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon\\ndiscovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of\\nthe column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;\\nwhether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great\\nWashington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in\\nBaltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that\\npoint of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral\\nNelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in\\nTrafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,\\ntoken is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\\nsmoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\\nNelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\\nbefriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\\nhowever it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the\\nthick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be\\nshunned.',\n",
       " 'It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not\\nso, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected\\nlofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by\\nmeans of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.\\nA few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New\\nZealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we\\nthen to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The\\nthree mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen\\ntaking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other\\nevery two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly\\npleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is\\ndelightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,\\nstriding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while\\nbeneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous\\nColossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of\\nthe sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\\nindolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\\ninto languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime\\nuneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras\\nwith startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into\\nunnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt\\nsecurities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what\\nyou shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more\\nare snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.',\n",
       " 'In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’\\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of\\nanything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you\\nstand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\\ncalled the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To\\nbe sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest\\nwatch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul\\nis glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about\\nin it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing\\n(like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a\\nwatch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of\\ndrawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\\nyour watch-coat.',\n",
       " 'Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\\npulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the\\nIcebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this\\nadmirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\\ncharmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\\n_crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s\\ngood craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of\\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other\\napparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something\\nlike a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is\\nfurnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head\\nin a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into\\nit through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or\\nside next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and\\nother nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his\\nmast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a\\nrifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask\\nand shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or\\nvagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\\nwater, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it\\nwas plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,\\nall the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he\\nso enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very\\nscientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small\\ncompass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors\\nresulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle\\nmagnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in\\nthe ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having\\nbeen so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though\\nthe Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\\nlearned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and\\n“approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail\\nbeing attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within\\neasy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and\\neven love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it\\nvery ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\\naloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the\\npole.',\n",
       " 'But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so\\nat last mount to my ultimate destination.',\n",

       " 'But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,\\nalmost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—',\n",
       " '“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\\nwhale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a\\nbroad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye\\nsee it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”',\n",
       " 'While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly\\nhumming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\\nvitality in him.',\n",
       " 'Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises\\nme a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\\npunctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”',\n",
       " '“Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.',\n",
       " '“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\\ntopmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”',\n",
       " 'All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\\nmore intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of\\nthe wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\\nseparately touched by some specific recollection.',\n",
       " '“Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that\\nsome call Moby Dick.”',\n",
       " '“Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”',\n",
       " '“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the\\nGay-Header deliberately.',\n",
       " '“And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a\\nparmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”',\n",
       " '“And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\\nCaptain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like\\nhim—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and\\nround as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”',\n",
       " '“Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted\\nand wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole\\nshock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the\\ngreat annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a\\nsplit jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have\\nseen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”',\n",
       " '“Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far\\nbeen eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain\\nAhab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off\\nthy leg?”',\n",
       " '“Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my\\nhearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that\\nbrought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted\\nwith a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\\n“Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor\\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with\\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him\\nround Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,\\nand round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye\\nhave shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,\\nand over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin\\nout. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\\nlook brave.”',\n",
       " '“Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the\\nexcited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for\\nMoby Dick!”',\n",
       " '“God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,\\nmen. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long\\nface about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not\\ngame for Moby Dick?”',\n",
       " '“I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I\\ncame here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many\\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”',\n",
       " '“Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\\nlittle lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the\\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,\\nlet me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”',\n",
       " '“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it\\nrings most vast, but hollow.”',\n",
       " '“Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee\\nfrom blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”',\n",
       " '“Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\\nare but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the\\nundoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth\\nthe mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\\noutside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\\nthat wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.\\nBut ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\\nstrength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable\\nthing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the\\nwhite whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\\nof blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\\nsun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\\nfair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\\nmaster, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no\\nconfines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is\\na doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted\\nthee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that\\nthing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small\\nindignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by\\nthe sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,\\nthat live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!\\nThe crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this\\nmatter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he\\nsnorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one\\ntost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to\\nhelp strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From\\nthis one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely\\nhe will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!\\nSpeak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.\\n(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\\nhis lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\\nrebellion.”',\n",
       " '“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.',\n",
       " 'But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\\nhold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor\\nyet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\\ntheir hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up\\nwith the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\\nwinds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\\nbefore. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\\nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows!

It seemed as though, by some\\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own\\nmagnetic life.

       " 'For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of\\nhis existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen\\nhim; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given\\nbattle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of\\nwhale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire\\nwatery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth\\nor more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any\\nsort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity\\nof the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,\\ndirect and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole\\nworld-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings\\nconcerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels\\nreported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or\\nsuch a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,\\nwhich whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair\\npresumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other\\nthan Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked\\nby various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and\\nmalice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by\\naccident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,\\nfor the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,\\nmore, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,\\nthan to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous\\nencounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\\nregarded.',\n",
       " 'And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one\\nof them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any\\nother whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue\\nin these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken\\nlimbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of\\nfatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and\\npiling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake\\nthe fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White\\nWhale had eventually come.',\n",
       " 'Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\\nterrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors\\nabound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.\\nAnd as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery\\nsurpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and\\nfearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only\\nare whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they\\nare by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is\\nappallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its\\ngreatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such\\nremotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a\\nthousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or\\naught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and\\nlongitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is\\nwrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many\\na mighty birth.',\n",
       " 'No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\\nthe widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in\\nthe end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\\nhalf-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\\neventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\\nthat visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\\njaw.',\n",
       " 'But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\\nperhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there\\nare plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered\\nthe Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is\\nrestricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;\\nseated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish\\nfireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern\\nwhaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale\\nanywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\\nwhich stem him.',\n",
       " 'And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\\ntimes thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\\nnaturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to\\nbe a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be\\nso incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost\\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\\nincluded) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the\\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with\\nsuch violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general\\nexperiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in\\ntheir full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the\\nsuperstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.',\n",
       " 'So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few\\nof the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be\\ninevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.',\n",
       " 'Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\\noffered.',\n",
       " 'One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was\\nthe unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\\ninstant of time.',\n",
       " 'Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit\\naltogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as\\nthe secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,\\neven to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm\\nWhale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to\\nhis pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious\\nand contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning\\nthe mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he\\ntransports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant\\npoints.',\n",
       " 'It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\\nseas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a\\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old\\ntimes of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.',\n",
       " 'Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and\\nknowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had\\nescaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen\\nshould go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\\nonly ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\\ntime); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\\nwould still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\\nspout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\\nagain in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied\\njet would once more be seen.',\n",
       " 'But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.',\n",
       " 'The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the\\nsame shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\\ngleamings.',\n",
       " 'Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\\ndeformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural\\nterror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to\\nspecific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.\\nMore than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than\\nperhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,\\nwith every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known\\nto turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their\\nboats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.',\n",
       " 'Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s\\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\\nunintelligent agent.',\n",
       " 'Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\\nwhite curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.',\n",
       " 'His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\\neddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\\ndashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly\\nseeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the\\nwhale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping\\nhis sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away\\nAhab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,\\nno hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming\\nmalice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness\\nagainst the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness\\nhe at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but\\nall his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam\\nbefore him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious\\nagencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left\\nliving on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity\\nwhich has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern\\nChristians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of\\nthe east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and\\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the\\nabhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All\\nthat most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;\\nall truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the\\nbrain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy\\nAhab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby\\nDick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general\\nrage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if\\nhis chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.',\n",
       " 'It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\\nthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in\\none hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian\\nCape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one\\nanother; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on\\nthe homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals\\nduring the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a\\nleg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was\\nmoreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to\\nlace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a\\nstrait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when\\nrunning into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails\\nspread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,\\nthe old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,\\nand issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the\\ndireful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,\\nraved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.\\nWhen you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some\\nstill subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly\\ncontracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows\\nnarrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his\\nnarrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been\\nleft behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural\\nintellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\\nconcentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\\nhis strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold\\nmore potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one\\nreasonable object.',\n",
       " 'This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\\nwe here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your\\nway, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root\\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that\\nproud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young\\nexiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\\nState-secret come.',\n",
       " 'Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him.',\n",
       " 'The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\nascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons\\nhe was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\\nidea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\\nOr, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\\nhis underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one\\nonly and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one\\nof his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking\\nin him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on\\nprofitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the\\nmint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural\\nrevenge.',\n",

Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\\ncries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\\nhold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\\nthing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\\ntowns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\\nhint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\\nnever had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never!

       " 'There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\\ndelirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\\nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were\\nfound there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and\\nunquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In\\ngeneral, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the\\nsolitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that\\nthough Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what\\nis called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on\\nthe Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to\\nvisit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she\\nwould infallibly encounter him there.

And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing\\nhis object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to\\nwhatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities\\nwould become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every\\npossibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and\\nplace were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the\\nSeason-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,\\nMoby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for\\nawhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of\\nthe deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the\\nwaves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot\\nwhere the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his\\nvengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering\\nvigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering\\nhunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one\\ncrowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those\\nhopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his\\nunquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.',\n",

Therefore, he must wait for the next\\nensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,\\nperhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very\\ncomplexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and\\nsixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead\\nof impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote\\nfrom his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow\\noff the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any\\nother waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,\\nNor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,\\nmight blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the\\nPequod’s circumnavigating wake.',\n",

Yes. For the peculiar\\nsnow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be\\nunmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to\\nhimself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\\nwould throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?\\nHis broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!\\nAnd here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a\\nweariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what\\ntrances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one\\nunachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes\\nwith his own bloody nails in his palms.',\n",

Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms\\nof some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the\\nplainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the\\nscheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab\\nthat had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to\\nburst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living\\nprinciple or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\\nfrom the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its\\nouter vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\\nscorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it\\nwas no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless\\nleagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s\\ncase, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme\\npurpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced\\nitself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\\nbeing of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common\\nvitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the\\nunbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that\\nglared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,\\nwas for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,\\na ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and\\ntherefore a blankness in itself.

No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance.

One day she saw spouts, lowered her\\nboats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\\nthe whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\\nfrom the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\\nship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that\\nin less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a\\nsurviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest\\nexposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being\\nreturned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific\\nin command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon\\nunknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly\\nlost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.\\nAt this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen\\nOwen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;\\nI have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his\\nson; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*',\n",
       " '*The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed\\nto warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\\ndirected his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at\\na short interval between them, both of which, according to their\\ndirection, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\\nahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\\nshock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were\\nnecessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\\nresentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\\nbefore entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as\\nif fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the\\nwhole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,\\nand producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,\\ncalculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which\\nimpressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am\\ncorrect in my opinion.”',\n",

Some weeks after, the Commodore set\\nsail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso.

But I should not much wonder if, in the\\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all\\ncaused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.',\n",
       " 'I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\\nboats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let\\nme say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will\\nfrequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for\\nseveral consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more\\nand a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,\\nby which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous\\nevent in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but\\nthat these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;\\nso that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is\\nnothing new under the sun.',\n",

       " 'Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\\ngainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\\nthis sea-monster was, is not mentioned.

For a long\\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on\\nthe Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the\\nskeleton of a sperm whale.

Or at least if\\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be\\nindeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,\\nthough not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling\\npassion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.',\n",
       " 'To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.

Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced\\nwill were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;\\nstill he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred\\nhis captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself\\nfrom it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would\\nelapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck\\nwould ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\\ncaptain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him.

For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had\\nhailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are\\nmore or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer\\nweather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any\\nobject remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and\\npassion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary\\ninterests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily\\nsuspended for the final dash.',\n",

Had they been strictly held to their one final\\nand romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have\\nturned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of\\nall hopes of cash—aye, cash.

As I\\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the\\nlong yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly\\nand unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess\\ndid there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only\\nbroken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as\\nif this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically\\nweaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of\\nthe warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging\\nvibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise\\ninterblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed\\nnecessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle\\nand weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,\\nQueequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof\\nslantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;\\nand by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding\\ncontrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s\\nsword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and\\nwoof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free\\nwill, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working\\ntogether. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\\nultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending\\nto that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;\\nand chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\\nnecessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\\nthus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\\nlast featuring blow at events.',\n",
       " 'Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of\\nfree will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\\nwhence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees\\nwas that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly\\nforward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden\\nintervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that\\nvery moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of\\nwhalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those\\nlungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous\\ncadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.',\n",
       " 'As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\\neagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\\nprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries\\nannouncing their coming.',\n",

For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\\nwhen, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\\nconcealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in\\nthe opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in\\naction; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by\\nTashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not\\nappointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the\\nmain-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the\\nline tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the\\nmainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three\\nsamphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager\\ncrews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly\\npoised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about\\nto throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.',\n",

The\\nfigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white\\ntooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese\\njacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black\\ntrowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness\\nwas a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and\\ncoiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the\\ncompanions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion\\npeculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race\\nnotorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white\\nmariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents\\non the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose\\nto be elsewhere.',\n",

       " 'Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth\\nkeel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and\\nshowed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the\\nstern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves\\nwidely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.

What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They\\nare only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more\\nthe merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are\\ngood fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a\\nthousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes!

He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear\\nsuch queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling\\nfor the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\\nand indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so\\nbroadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a\\nyawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\\nthe crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,\\nwhose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all\\ninferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.',\n",
       " 'In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\\nacross Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\\npretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.',\n",

       " 'Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\\nas the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\\nawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s\\ncompany; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got\\nabroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\\nsmall measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\\nof their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of\\naccounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\\nsuperstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room\\nfor all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in\\nthe matter from the beginning.

Those tiger\\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\\ntrip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\\nboiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\\npulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\\ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\\nhorizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\\nfencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\\nany tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\\nfixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat\\nand crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in\\nthe rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\\ndown into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\\nmovement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.',\n",

       " 'Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\\nstood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\\nspot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\\nthe gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.',\n",
       " 'Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still;\\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\\nthe level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\\nwhale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,\\nand standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\\nmast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\\nKing-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post\\nwas full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead\\nstand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.',\n",

Still more strange to see him giddily\\nperched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\\nsight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more\\ncurious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,\\nunthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the\\nsea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired\\nFlask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.\\nThough truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby\\ngive to the negro’s lordly chest.

The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his\\nmatch across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed\\nstars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,\\ncrying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give\\nway!—there they are!”',\n",

The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\\nwater, also, the whales were swimming.

       " '“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\\nintensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\\nvisible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\\nto his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.',\n",

And as for\\nsmall difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril\\nof life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen\\nand unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am\\nspeaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;\\nit comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before\\nmight have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part\\nof the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to\\nbreed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with\\nit I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White\\nWhale its object.',\n",
       " '“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the\\ndeck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the\\nwater; “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\\nhappen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he\\ngave me to understand that such things did often happen.',\n",
       " '“Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I\\nthink I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief\\nmate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose\\nthen, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\\nsquall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”',\n",
       " '“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\\nCape Horn.”',\n",
       " '“Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\\nclose by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into\\ndeath’s jaws?”',\n",
       " '“Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I\\nshould like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face\\nforemost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\\nthat!”',\n",
       " 'Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement\\nof the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings\\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of\\ncommon occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the\\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign\\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow\\nwho at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of\\nscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that\\nthe particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\\nimputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a\\nsquall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for\\nhis great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to\\nthis uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in\\nwhat a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking\\nall things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make\\na rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be\\nmy lawyer, executor, and legatee.”',\n",
       " 'It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at\\ntheir last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world\\nmore fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical\\nlife that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded\\nupon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled\\naway from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as\\ngood as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a\\nsupplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might\\nbe. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.\\nI looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a\\nclean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.',\n",

       " '“Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg\\nyou would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole\\nwith my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”',\n",
       " '“I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.\\n“If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.\\nThat would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other\\nleft, you know.”',\n",
       " '“I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”',\n",
       " 'Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering\\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it\\nis right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active\\nperils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in\\ntheir eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried\\ninto the thickest of the fight.',\n",
       " 'But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that\\nwith two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\\nextraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\\ncomprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed\\nman to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the\\njoint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.',\n",
       " 'Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\\nthe chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\\nhis orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually\\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for\\nCaptain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s\\ncrew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\\nof the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s\\ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\\nmatter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little\\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of\\nport, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety\\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it\\nis sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing\\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee\\nfixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the\\ncarpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a\\nlittle there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and\\ncuriosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to\\nthe ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his\\nintention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition\\ndid by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew\\nbeing assigned to that boat.',\n",
       " 'Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\\nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\\nwhalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,\\noars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that\\nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\\nto chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\\nexcitement in the forecastle.',\n",
       " 'But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\\nsomehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a\\nmuffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like\\nthis, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\\nlinked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort\\nof a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even\\nauthority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an\\nindifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as\\ncivilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide\\namong the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles\\nto the east of the continent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable\\ncountries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the\\nghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory\\nof the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his\\ndescendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real\\nphantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and\\nto what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed\\nconsorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the\\nuncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off\\nthe Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of\\nthe Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery\\nlocality, southerly from St. Helena.',\n",
       " 'It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\\nthe sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\\nnights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a\\nhundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what\\nemotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at\\nsuch unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But\\nwhen, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive\\nnights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,\\nhis unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,\\nevery reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit\\nhad lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she\\nblows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was\\na most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\\nexciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\\nlowering.',\n",
       " 'Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\\nt’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\\nbest man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\\nof so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\\nbeneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\\ninfluences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the\\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\\nAhab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively\\nechoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a\\ncoffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship\\nso swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\\nglances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every\\nsailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.',\n",
       " 'This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\\nafter, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\\nwas descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\\ndisappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\\nnight, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted\\ninto the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\\ndisappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and\\nsomehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still\\nfurther and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever\\nalluring us on.',\n",
       " 'Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\\nthe Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\\nwhenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by\\none self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there\\nreigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as\\nif it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\\nmonster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\\nand most savage seas.',\n",
       " 'These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a\\nwondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in\\nwhich, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a\\ndevilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so\\nwearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful\\nerrand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.',\n",
       " 'But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began\\nhowling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas\\nthat are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the\\nblast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of\\nsilver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this\\ndesolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more\\ndismal than before.',\n",
       " 'Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\\nbefore us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\\nevery morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\\nspite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a\\nthing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for\\ntheir homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved\\nthe black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great\\nmundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering\\nit had bred.',\n",
       " 'Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called\\nof yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\\nattended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where\\nguilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed\\ncondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat\\nthat black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and\\nunvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still\\nbeckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be\\ndescried.',\n",
       " 'During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for\\nthe time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous\\ndeck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever\\naddressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything\\nabove and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but\\npassively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become\\npractical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its\\naccustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for\\nhours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very\\neyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of\\nthe ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,\\nstood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to\\nguard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a\\nsort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened\\nbelt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by\\npainted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift\\nmadness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness\\nof humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence\\nthe men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the\\nblast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not\\nseek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old\\nman’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the\\nbarometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his\\nfloor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from\\nwhich he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the\\nunremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of\\nthose charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken\\nof. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body\\nwas erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were\\npointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in\\nthe ceiling.*',\n",
